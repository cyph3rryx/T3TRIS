## Terminal Based T3TRIS
This is a simple implementation of the classic game Tetris that runs in the terminal. The game is written in Python and uses the curses library to create the interface.

## How to play

To play the game, simply run the script in a terminal window:

`python base_game.py`

The game will start automatically. The goal of the game is to clear as many lines as possible by fitting tetromino pieces together as they fall from the top of the screen. Use the arrow keys to move the pieces left and right, and the down arrow key to drop the piece quickly.

## Requirements

To run the game, you need to have `Python 3.x` installed on your machine. 

Additionally, the game requires the curses library, which is included with most Unix-based operating systems. 

If you are using Windows, you may need to install the windows-curses package.

Feel free to use and modify the code as you like. Enjoy!
